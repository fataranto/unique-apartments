# Node.js Express apartments temporary rent with login and registration with MongoDB and JWT

The aim of this app is to create a system to publish apartments in Catalunya. There are three user roles: user, host and admin. When registered, users can search and book an apartment. Hosts can publish, delete and edit already published apartments. Admins have a total control of the application, can create and delete users, edit published apartments and manage data from database such total published apartments, total rented apartments, users, etc.
